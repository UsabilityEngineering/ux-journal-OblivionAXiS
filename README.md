# Adrian's User eXperience Portfolio

I'm Adrian Spinali, a senior at Chico State and majoring in Computer Science. My hobbies include playing video games (primarily indie games on PC), making mods for my favorite games, and both listening to and composing video game-style music, the latter via FL Studio. I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, though it's hard to find time to play it.
